# Arminia

## Introduction

[Arminia](https://arminia.com.au/) explores the 2D / 3D geometry of the unified field and the 13 information systems of the Fruit of Life. The construction of geometry is done with [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/), which is used as an online straight edge and compass. The straight edge and compass is a tool that can reveal powerful relationships in geometry, line and number. When a workbook or challenge is complete, the user will gain diagrams, art and instructions to build the construction with a real straight edge and compass.

To help users better understand new and cutting edge math papers, Arminia integrates the Computation Algebra System (CAS) of Geogebra to step through each mathematical equation.

## Status

Arminia is in early development and most of the functionality is complete, however the main content or model, consisting of geometric constructions and math paper walkthroughs have not been added. 

The following features are complete:
- 3D viewer UI
- 2D viewer and skill tree UI
- Geogebra integration with constructions and math papers
- general website functionality and theme
- persistent skill tracking

The following geometry constructions are complete:
- The Circle 
- The Vesica Piscis
- The Triquetra
- The Genesis Pattern
- The Completed Flower of Life
- The Fruit of Life
- The Unsealed Flower of Life
- The Sealed Flower of Life

The following peer reviewed scientiffic papers are complete in the CAS:
- The Schwarzschild Proton Paper by Nassim Harramein

The following features are either not functioning or incomplete:
- persistent achievements
- persistent rewards
- documentation
- some skill tree constructions and Information Systems i.e. Music, Enneagram and Holofractalgraphic Fruit of Life
